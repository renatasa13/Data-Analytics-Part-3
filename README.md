# 1.2 Data Preparation 
- Code used:
- Python version: 3.11.4 
- Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# 1.3 Data Profiling
- Load the Data
- Check the Data
- After checking the data, there are columns that have missing values, there are  children, country, agent and company columns. Therefore, there is a need for a data cleaning process

# 1.4 Data Cleansing
- Duplicate data can have a significant impact on the data cleansing process. Duplicate data cted.an skew prediction results, contaminate the training data with the test data, or vice versa.
- Therefore, it is important to check and remove duplicates before performing any data analysis or modeling.
- The data set is not clean. We have 4 features with missing values.
- The data in the Age column is in numerical form with non-normal data distribution or skewness. Therefore, missing values can be handled by replacing them with medians.
- The data in the Country column is in categorical (string) form. Therefore, missing values can be handled by replacing them with the mode. 
- The data in the Agent column is in categorical form (ID of the travel agency that made the booking). Therefore, missing values can be handled by replacing them with the mode.
- The data in the Company column have missing value and because the percentage of null values is greater than 50, the column must be removed or deleted.

- From this chart, it can be seen that there was more than double bookings were made in 2016, compared to the previous year, but decrease in the number of visitors coming from 2016 to 2017 for each hotel. There was a decrease of around 42.5% in Resort Hotels compared to the previous year, while in City Hotels there was a decrease of around 42.9% from the previous year. This decline figure almost reached half of the previous year's visits. Therefore, hotels need to make efforts to increase the number of visitors in the following year, for example by providing attractive discounts and promotions.

-  From this chart, there was a trend of decreasing number of customers at the beginning and end of the year. However, there was a spike in the number of customers between June and August of 33% at City Hotels and more than 77% at Resort Hotels, but fell in the following months. Therefore, efforts are needed to increase the number of visits, such as promotions by offering certain attractive facilities at the beginning and end of the year, as well as providing more rooms between June and August with good facilities and services to maintain customer loyalty so that there is no decline. which was quite extreme in the following month.

- Based on this data, it shows the number of hotel orders every month. Based on this, August is the month with the most visitors (12.8%) and January is the month with the fewest visitors (5.3%), January is only half as many as August. So hotels must pay attention to what must be done so that visitors can increase.

5. Trade-Offs When Balancing Interpretability and Accuracy:
- Definition: There are situations where you must choose between maintaining data interpretability and achieving higher accuracy. For example, very complex machine learning models may offer high accuracy but are harder to interpret.
- Example: A Data Analytics or Data Scientist In credit scoring, a simple model that uses just a few variables may be more interpretable, even if it's less accurate, while a complex neural network might have higher accuracy but is less transparent.
- Image example: ![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-27 at 19 42 15_88f2496c](https://github.com/Nirmalafauzhia/Data-Analytics-Part-3/assets/146448514/744b4ba2-41a5-4b7c-817b-e2a2929a6e26)
  
6. Shortcomings of Making Population-Level Generalizations with Limited Sample Data:
- Definition: When making generalizations about an entire population based on a limited sample, there are risks of error. The sample may not fully represent the variation within the population.
- Example: the share of U.S. adults who said they had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose by June 2021 was roughly two-thirds based on data from both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (66%) and Center polling (67%). While not perfect, this level of accuracy is usually sufficient for getting a meaningful read of the publicâ€™s mood on key issues.
- Image example: ![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-27 at 19 42 17_a351c114](https://github.com/Nirmalafauzhia/Data-Analytics-Part-3/assets/146448514/ea0b84ce-9820-4928-b196-7ecfaf711a94)

# 2.3 Given a scenario, describe types of bias that affect collection and interpretation of data
- It is important to recognize and address these biases in data collection and interpretation to ensure the integrity and validity of the findings. This can involve careful study design, transparent methodology, and rigorous data analysis techniques to mitigate bias as much as possible.

1. Confirmation bias 
- (is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's existing beliefs or hypotheses)
- Definition: Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when we only seek out. information that confirms our existing beliefs, while ignoring or downplaying information that contradicts them.
- Example: A person who believes that climate change is not real may only seek out information from sources that support their belief, while ignoring or downplaying information from sources that contradict it.
- Image example: ![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-27 at 19 42 17_e1e00e23](https://github.com/Nirmalafauzhia/Data-Analytics-Part-3/assets/146448514/6cd37511-7c3a-4080-a01c-dbd6a1a1e240)

2. Human cognitive bias
- (is a mental shortcut that can lead to errors in judgment. Cognitive biases are based on our experiences, emotions, and assumptions.)
- Definition: Human cognitive bias is a mental shortcut that can lead to errors in judgment. Cognitive biases are based on our experiences, emotions, and assumptions.
- Examples: Availability bias: The tendency to give more weight to information that is more readily available. Anchoring bias: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making a decision. Representativeness bias: The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how similar it is to other events we are familiar with.
- Image example: ![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-27 at 19 42 18_ba161576](https://github.com/Nirmalafauzhia/Data-Analytics-Part-3/assets/146448514/86b51a39-ed55-4b33-8dfc-dabdb2e09b19)

3. Motivational bias 
- (is a type of bias that occurs when our motivations influence our collection or interpretation of data.)
- Definition: A tendency to collect or interpret data in a way that supports one's desired outcome.
- Example: A pharmaceutical company may design a clinical trial in a way that is biased in favor of its new drug. For example, the company may recruit participants who are more likely to respond favorably to the drug, or use a dosage that is higher than what is typically used in real-world practice.
- Image example: ![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-27 at 19 42 18_7353b753](https://github.com/Nirmalafauzhia/Data-Analytics-Part-3/assets/146448514/e134fe2e-87f6-4434-99b6-17e8aa0f2adf)

4. Sampling bias 
- (occurs when the sample of data collected is not representative of the population that it is intended to represent.)
- Definition: Sampling bias occurs when the sample of data collected is not representative of the population that it is intended to represent.
- Examples:The child is only scooping out the red jelly beans. This means that the sample of jelly beans that the child collects will not be representative of the entire bowl of jelly beans, but will be biased towards red jelly beans. Sampling bias is a serious problem in research because it can lead to inaccurate results. It is important to be aware of sampling bias and to take steps to avoid it when designing and conducting research studies.
- Image example: ![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-27 at 19 42 19_3de8a22a](https://github.com/Nirmalafauzhia/Data-Analytics-Part-3/assets/146448514/d867e049-8771-4d8c-a907-300ee5ba1396)

5. Selecting visualizations/data representations to avoid bias
- Definition: When selecting visualizations and data representations, it is important to be aware of the potential for bias. Some visualizations and data representations can be more misleading than others. Here are some tips for selecting visualizations and data representations to avoid bias: Use visualizations that are accurate and easy to understand. Avoid using visualizations that are misleading or manipulative. Be transparent about how the data was collected and analyzed. Use multiple visualizations to represent the same data, and compare the results.
- Example: Using a bar chart to compare two groups of people is a good way to avoid bias, because bar charts are easy to understand and do not distort the data. However, using a pie chart to compare the same two groups could be misleading, because pie charts can make small differences appear larger.
